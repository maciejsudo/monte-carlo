# monte-carlo
## Project Description
This repository contains a Python script that shows the calculation of a given integral 
using the Monte Carlo method. The script also includes functions that make it possible to estimate 
the number of draws sufficient to provide a specific value of the variance. 
For this purpose, the bisection method was used. 
Additionally, an alternative solution using the three-sigma rule was presented, 
allowing to improve convergence of results.
A detailed description of the project can be found in the `ProjectDocumentation.pdf` file.
